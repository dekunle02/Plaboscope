    <string name="info">Hello. I made this app to provide the help I would have wanted in my preparation for the PLAB 1 examination. It contains the commonly distributed 1700 questions and a few extras. Added features include:\n\n  <b>Modes</b>: You can opt for practice where you will get the chance of seeing the correct answers before the next question, or Exam, where you will not have this chance and in addition the test will be timed!\n\n <b>Liking:</b> You can choose to like any question for later review while doing a test. You can do this by either pressing down on the question or tapping the little heart icon at the top of the screen. This is especially useful for some rather problematic questions. You can later see these questions using the (my question button) available on the home screen.\n\n <b>Saving:</b> You will notice that there is a save icon present at all times during a test. This allows you to save your current progress, time and score in one of 3 available slots. Especially useful for those of us who are working and trying to study on the go. You can later wipe the slots by holding the button till the option pops up.\n\n <b>Results:</b>You will get a result of a test at the end of the test. This will include the total number of correct and wrong answers, and how long you spent on the test. \n\n <b>THANK YOU! Happy practicing! Do not forget to share with our other colleagues who want to write this exam.</b></string>

        <item>The key is B. Flexible cystoscopy. [Painless hematuria in an elderly (here 65 years old man) indicates carcinoma bladder for which flexible cystoscopy is done. Here BEP is not advanced to cause hemorrhage. There is mild enlargement of prostate and mild symptoms of prostration and hemorrhage is unlikely at this initial stage of BEP which makes Bladder cancer as the likely cause of painless hematuria. It is also less likely to be prostate cancer as symptoms of prostration are mild (indicates disease is not advanced). Moreover bleeding in cancer prostate is less common].</item>
        <item>The key is C. Ectopic The patient is smoker and probably developed squamous cell lung cancer which is working as a tumour producing ectopic ACTH causing pigmentation. Resulting raised cortisole is leading to diabetes and hypokalemia (though small cell carcinoma is usual cause but squamous cell carcinoma can produce ectopic ACTH as paraneoplastic syndrome also)]</item>
        <item>The key is B. TFT. [The patient has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that is why there is no arrhythmia in between attacks. From the given option TFT is the appropriate test as thyrotoxicosis is a leading cause of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and this ladies weight loss also makes thyrotoxicosis as the probable cause here].</item>
        <item>The key is B. Prostate Carcinoma. First to say in this case (almost all features goes in favour of prostatic carcinoma like-  frequency, urgency and terminal dribbling are features of prostatism. Age, anorexia and anaemia are constitutional features of carcinoma prostate and it would be accurate presentation if it was hypercalcaemia. But given calcium level is of hypocalcaemic level and it is the main cause of discrepancy of this question). Renal failure can be an association of malignant disease and can cause high BP.  Thirst is a feature of hypercalcaemia  (here may be erroneously calcium level is given in hypocalcaemic level ; probably a bad recall).  Prostate biopsy is the confirmatory diagnosis and others like PSA is suggestive. </item>
        <item>The key is C. Citalopram. Among SSRIs Sertraline is the drug of choice for ischemic heart disease. Next choice is citalopram (as it is often related to torsades de pointes it is not 1st choice). If SSRI cannot be used Mirtazapine is recommended as next antidepressant].</item>
        <item>The key is D. Medulla. [The name of the condition is �Lateral medullary syndrome� [ipsilateral Horner syndrome and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sense].</item>
        <item> The key is A. Achalasia. [Dysphagia for both solid and liquid or prominently liquid suggest achalasia where dysphagia to solid suggest stricture. Also gross dilatation of oesophagus with smooth narrowing at lower end is seen in achalasia. In achalasia dysphagia is usually described as progressive].</item>
        <item> Removal of harmonically active tumour. [Ectopic ACTH secreting tumour causes hypernatremia and bodys homeostatic mechanism try to lower the level of high sodium and do a lesser degree though sodium remains in hypernatremic level or even it may be normal (this question does not mention any preoperative hypernatremia). Removal of that tumour results in negative sodium balance for time being which results hyponatremia while gradually it tends to rise again to normal level].</item>
        <item>The key is B. LMWH. [Injections with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are usually used to treat pregnant women with DVT. LMWH is an anticoagulant, which means it prevents the blood clot getting bigger. It does not affect the developing baby (www.nhs.uk)].</item>
        <item>The likely key is A. Joint aspiration for cytology and culture and sensitivity. [Case of septic arthritis. Any chronically arthritic joint is predisposed to infection. Moreover chronic use of steroid in Rh. arthritis is one of the important predisposing factor.  In this age group likely organism is Staphylococcus. In younger age group Neisseria gonorrhea is more common].</item>
        <item>The key is D. Prostate carcinoma. . [Age, nocturia, urgency and dribbling points towards prostate pathology. Pain of lower back and hip points towards bony metastases from prostate cancer. Blood test for PSA; Prostate biopsy; MRI (if initial biopsy is negative, to decide repeat biopsy).Treatment options: 1. Active treatment [i) radical prostatectomy ii) radical radiotherapy iii) hormone therapy iv) brachytherapy v) pelvic radiotherapy vi) orchidectomy 2.Active surveillance 3. Watchful waiting 4. Palliative care (Source: NICE)]. </item>
        <item>The key is A Shingles. [Here ophthalmic division of trigeminal nerve is involved. Typically shingles are unilateral].</item>
        <item>The key is C. LFT. A case of autoimmune hepatitis. Autoimmune hepatitis is an uncommon cause of chronic hepatitis which if untreated can lead to cirrhosis. However with treatment outlook is very good. Smooth muscle antibody is positive in autoimmune hepatitis. Definitive investigation is liver biopsy. Treated with steroid [start with high dose prednisolone]. Azathioprine is commonly added with steroid to reduce its dose as steroid has more side effects than azathioprine [</item>
        <item>The key is B. Sweat test. [Recurrent chest pain from frequent lung infections including pneumonia or bronchitis. “Clubbing" of the fingers is a classic features of Cystic Fibrosis, although not present in many patients.  The digestive enzymes are not being produced, food is not adequately digested (malabsorption) and excess fat and protein is lost in the stools, making them bulky, oily, smelly and difficult to flush away].</item>
        <item>The key is C. Small cells with round nucleus and scant indistinct cytoplasm (Lobular carcinoma)</item>
        <item>The key is B. Oculomotor nerve. [3rd nerve damage can cause fixed dilated pupil].</item>
        <item>The key is D. Universal prevention application protocol.</item>
        <item>The key is D. All family members should be given rifampicin prophylaxis. [Meningococcal disease. Diagnosis is done with blood or CSF PCR. Initial prehospital management: Benzyl penicillin or cefotaxime. </item>

The oral agents that are thought to be relatively safe in patients with nondialysis CKD include short-acting sulfonylureas (eg, glipizide) and repaglinide. If an oral agent is used, the short-acting sulfonylurea, glipizide, is the preferred agent among nondialysis CKD patients who have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than30 mL/min/1.73. The dose for glipizide is 2.5 to 10 mg/day. Glyburide and other long-acting sulfonylureas are generally not recommended in any CKD patient with type 2 diabetes, because of the risk of hypoglycemia. Some clinicians recommend the use of the meglitinide repaglinide (starting with a dose of 0.5 mg) for nondialysis CKD patients since these agents are not renally cleared. Nondialysis CKD patients with type 2 diabetes may be treated with an oral agent, although many patients end up on insulin therapy because it is more effective.
